All Makercoin STL files have a 100mm diameter to make scaling easy.

A .STL file is a commonly used file type in the manufracturing world that contains mesh data about a object so it can be manufractured.

The .STL files are used in this project for 3D Printing the coins. This file provides information about the size and shape of the model to the slicer (the program that controls the 3D Printer's movements) so that the object/part can then be built.
