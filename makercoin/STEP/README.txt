 .STEP fies are a universal CAD format that can be used in most cad formats to edit the design of a part.
 It is a CAD format that is used widely in sharing and making designs "open source". This is due in part that every designer has a diferent preference on which CAD package they like to use.
 I have included this format in this repository if the design needs to be modified.
