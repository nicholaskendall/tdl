a .svg (scaled vector graphics) file is a 2D Cad format that is used for logos, special text, graphics, ETC.
For this project, I have used affinity designer to create the .svg files that makeup the curved text around the coin that reads "CCDC ARMY RESEARCH LABORTORY TATICAL DISTRIBUTED LEDGER"
A .svg file was imported into fusion360 to act as a "Sketch". fusion360 has the ability to treat a .svg file as a sketch.
Fusion360 does not (at the time of writing this) doe snot have tha ability to bind text to a shape.
